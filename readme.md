# ARSS RSS Feeder

Using [SimplePie](http://simplepie.org), this will interpret RSS (and Atom) feeds.
The default is the BBC Home News feed. There is now an experimental aggregated
feed, which seems to work OK.

## MongoDB
[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) is used to store more feeds.
I have it installed as a Windows Service, as that seems the best way to use it.

## Bootstrap

Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) front-end framework is used 
for most of the styling. As part of that, the editor uses 
[GlyphIcons](http://glyphicons.com/) for the delete, edit, and go icons in 
the feed list table and the update button in the edit form.

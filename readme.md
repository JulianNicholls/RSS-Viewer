# ARSS RSS Feed Viewer

Using [SimplePie](http://simplepie.org), this will interpret RSS (and Atom) feeds.
The default is the BBC Home News feed. There is now an experimental aggregated
feed, which seems to work OK.

Also included is an editor, which is linked to from the feeds panel.

## MongoDB

[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) is used to store more feeds.
I have it installed as a Windows Service, as that seems the best way to use it.

## Bootstrap

Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) version 3.0 front-end framework
is used for most of the styling. As part of that, the editor uses 
[GlyphIcons](http://glyphicons.com/) for many of the buttons.
